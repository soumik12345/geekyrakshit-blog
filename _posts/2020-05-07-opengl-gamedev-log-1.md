# OpenGL GameDev Log 1: Setting Up GLFW

[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan development on the desktop. It provides a simple API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events.

GLFW is written in C and supports Windows, macOS, the X Window System and the Wayland protocol.

Following are the steps to set up GLFW with Visual Studio 2019 on Windows 10:
